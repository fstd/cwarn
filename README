# cwarn
complain about bad C test cases

This is work in progress.

NOTE: cwarn_slave.sh instances should run in a sandbox.
NOTE: a firewall MUST restrict who may talk to cwarn_slave.sh (ONLY the host where cwarn.sh/cwarn.pl run should be able to)

Quick setup:
------------
Master:
0. Have curl, perl, ncat (from nmap) installed
1. Put cwarn.sh and shboil.inc.sh somewhere in $PATH
2. Adjust top variables in cwarn.pl (to be de-hardcoded later)
3. Add slaves (host <space> port) lines to the slaves file (a variable in step 2)
4. Run cwarn.pl


Slaves:
1. Put shboil.inc.sh into $PATH
2. Run cwarn_slave.sh -c 'comp1:flags1,comp2:flags2,...' listenIP listenPort
(e.g. cwarn_slave.sh -c 'gcc:-std=c99 -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-variable -Wall -Wextra,clang:-std=c99 -fno-caret-diagnostics -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-variable -Wall -Wextra' 0.0.0.0 12345)
